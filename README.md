# DATS6450-TimeSeriesAnalysis-EnergyPrediction
DATS6450 Final individual project for DATS 6450 Time Series Analysis - Fall 2020

"energy.py" is the main project python file. It uses "functions.py" for non-library functions developed. 

NOTES:
- In the "energy.py" file, the stepwise regression section(line 165) and Holt_Winters sections(lines 493, 496, and 499) take a very long time to run (about an hour each)
- "energydata_complete_halfhourly.csv" is the main data file used in this project. Please use it for validating results (replace your local path in line 34)
- "energydata_complete.csv" is the original data file from the source (listed in the Resources section of the report. Steps taken to rework the data are justified and described in the Introduction section of the report.
- "energydata_complete_halfhourly_working.xlsx" is where I refactored "energydata_complete.csv"
